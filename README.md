# GIPHYApp
## Access published page [HERE](https://kylecom2000.github.io/GIPHYApp/).

### Main Function
* This project has buttons populated from an array with search terms used to pull GIFs from GIPHY's API and displays them on the page 10 at a time.

### App Features
* JavaScript and jQuery to change HTML.
* GIPHY API to populate GIFs.
* AJAX for retrieving data from GIPHY.
* Change the "data state" (animate/still) by clicking.
* Search box adds buttons to page for querying GIPHY.

### Notes
* The homework called for a GIPHY search and I chose to use the random API option as I wanted to not get the same 10 GIFs returned when you press the same button. It runs the query multiple times and returns the GIFs one at a time but it won't be the same each click. HOWEVER, with that, the rating tag doesn't come with the AJAX response so I chose to leave it out and use title instead.
